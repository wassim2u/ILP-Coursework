# Planner System for Autonomous Drone Collecting Sensor Readings in a Map




The repository contains two folders, aqmaps and heatmap for the two separate marked courseworks for the Informatics Large Practical Course. The bulk of the semester was spent on aqmaps for implementing a drone route planner algorithm.

heatmap: 23/25 - Visualising a “heat map” over the drone confinement area through Geo-JSON maps.
aqmap: 66/75 - The task is to program an autonomous drone which will collect readings from air quality sensors distributed around an urban geographical area as part of a (fictitious) research project to analyse urban air quality. The drone must reach all required sensors in a map in a given area provided some constraints including the number of maximal movements allowed and while avoiding no-fly-zones, areas which the drone is not allowed to cross.

The ilp-report.pdf was written at the end to document the project. It contains description of the Software Architecture of the program, brief overview on the class documentation used generated by Javadoc comments written through code, and the drone control algorithm
